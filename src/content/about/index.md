Hello! I’m Alessandro, a blockchain engineer based in Felegara, Italy.

I’m very passionate about blockchain plus software-development in general.
I love working in this industry and getting to build new things, but love even more that I get to constantly learn & discover new things. When I’m not at my desk you can usually find me out fishing, swimming or riding motocross.
